## Sbout this project
This project was developed for a full stack internship test. The project performs web scraping on Amazon products, fetching some product data according to the keyword provided by the user.

Below are the instructions for you to run the project:
## Instructions
It is necessary to have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Accessing the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder (at the root of the project) in your terminal.
2. Execute the command `start index.html` (Windows) or `xdg-open index.html` (Linux/macOS).

This command will open the project's frontend in your browser, but **before using it**, follow the **next step** in which you will run the backend.
## Step 2: Accessing the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder (at the root of the project) in your terminal.
2. Execute the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Make sure there are no other scripts running on port 3000, which is the one being used by this script.
4. Execute the command `npm run dev` to start the server.

Done! Now the project is running!

## Step 3: Use
To use it, simply go to the page opened in your browser when you accessed the frontend and enter the keyword for the search. If there are products related to the keyword, some information about them will appear for you: Title, ratings, reviews, image URL.
